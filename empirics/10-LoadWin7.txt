Research - 
1. Create loop device file from win7.raw image on mainChe PC.
~/src/wayland-kiosk-alpine/loop-device-grub.txt

2. Load Win7 loop device in qemu on mainChe PC.
3. Load Win7 loop in qemu SDL on arch without wayland on miniarch.
4. Load Win7 loop in qemu SDL on arch with wayland on miniarch.
5. Prepare arch with qemu loop device for ProdEnv.

ProdEnv
1. Boot grub4dos with Choose Boot Image Backend.
2. Boot arch loop device(R5) via grub4dos from Win7 hard disk.
3. Run qemu with grahics determined at R3,4 steps.
4. Quemu guest should be Win7 loop device.

In summary - 
01 - 2 loop files at Wni7 drive - 1) arch; 2) Win7.
02 - May be need patch grub4dos for Choose Boot Image Backend.
